# Recognize i386 signal trampolines before CFI.  Ensures that signal
# frames are identified as signal frames.
Patch101: gdb-6.3-sigx86-20040621.patch
= Maybe - no longer needed as glibc has CFI now.
= http://sourceware.org/ml/gdb-patches/2008-11/threads.html#00554
= TODO: Check non-x86 arches

# Fix to ensure types are visible
Patch120: gdb-6.3-type-fix-20041213.patch

# Tolerate DW_AT_type referencing <0>.
Patch139: gdb-6.3-dwattype0-20050201.patch

# Do not let errors related with debug registers break thread debugging.
Patch178: gdb-6.3-catch-debug-registers-error-20060527.patch
= i386 debug registers are always accessible by ptrace,
= the ia64 bug is both gone and also RHEL-6 ia64 no longer supports i386

# Cope with waitpid modifying status even when returning zero, as on
# ia32el.
Patch179: gdb-6.3-ia32el-fix-waitpid-20060615.patch
= broken i386 emulation on ia64, no longer supported

# Fixed the kernel i386-on-x86_64 VDSO loading (producing `Lowest section in').
Patch277: gdb-6.6-vdso-i386-on-amd64-warning.patch
= IMO no longer needed on 4KB VDSO again
